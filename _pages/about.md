Hi, I’m Alberto Confente.  
I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering (or *Ingegneria Informatica*, as we say in Italian) at the **[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/)**. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Informatics at **[TUM (Technical University of Munich)](https://www.tum.de/)**, with a focus on applying Machine Learning techniques to tackle Robotics challenges.  

I previously worked at **[Angsa Robotics](https://angsa-robotics.com/)**, where I contributed to building a trash-picking robot, and I am currently doing an internship at the **[National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/)** in Tokyo, focusing on Meta Learning and Continual Learning.  

If you're curious about my work, feel free to explore the **[Projects section]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }})**.
